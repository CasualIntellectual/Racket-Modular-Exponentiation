# Racket Modular Exponentiation


This was an exercise for me to write a program using properties of modulus (specifically congruence power and congruence multiply/divide)
to more efficiently calculate the modulo of very large exponents.

While a built-in library already exists to do so, this small project was an opportunity for me to apply my Racket and algebra skills to 
try and match the efficiency of (modular-expt) from (require math/number-theory).
